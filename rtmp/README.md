# RTMP

Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is a communication protocol for streaming
audio, video, and data over the Internet. Originally developed as a proprietary
protocol by Macromedia for streaming between Flash Player and the Flash
Communication Server, Adobe (which acquired Macromedia) has released an
incomplete version of the specification of the protocol for public use.

The RTMP protocol has multiple variations:

* RTMP proper, the "plain" protocol which works on top of Transmission Control
  Protocol (TCP) and uses port number 1935 by default.
* RTMPS, which is RTMP over a Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) connection.
* RTMPE, which is RTMP encrypted using Adobe's own security mechanism. While
  the details of the implementation are proprietary, the mechanism uses industry
  standard cryptographic primitives.
* RTMPT, which is encapsulated within HTTP requests to traverse firewalls. RTMPT
  is frequently found utilizing cleartext requests on TCP ports 80 and 443 to
  bypass most corporate traffic filtering. The encapsulated session may carry
  plain RTMP, RTMPS, or RTMPE packets within.
* RTMFP, which is RTMP over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead of TCP,
  replacing RTMP Chunk Stream. The Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol suite
  has been developed by Adobe Systems and enables end‚Äêusers to connect and
  communicate directly with each other (P2P).
